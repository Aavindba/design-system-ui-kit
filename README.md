### The Ask
The SLDS team welcomes your help in maintaining and growing this UI kit. 

Here are a few of the kinds of contributions we are looking for:
1.  **Bug fixes:** fixing goofs in the Sketch file where what it has for a component doesn’t match what we are displaying for that component in the code-based documentation 
2.  **New Pattern:** sharing your design for arranging several components into a useful UI widget
3.  **New Template:** sharing a more complex design that contains components and patterns arranged into an entire screen layout

### Got something to add?

3. Edit the Sketch UI Kit file to include your changes
