### The Ask
The SLDS team welcomes your help in maintaining and growing this  UI kit. 

Because team bandwidth is necessarily prioritized to the growth and development of the SLDS code itself we are not always able to keep this file in sync with the code state of the system.

Here are a few of the kinds of contributions we are looking for:
1.  **Bug fixes:** you have corrected a case where a component symbol in the file does not match the code representation of the component
2.  **New Pattern:** you have arranged a set of components into a pattern that you believe is has general utility
3.  **New Template:** you have laid out a set of patterns into a template that you believe has general utility

### The Contribution Process
What you do:
1. [Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) this repo
2. Make a new [branch](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/)
3. Edit the Sketch UI Kit file to include your changes
3. Create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)

What we’ll do:
1. Review your pull request
2.  Provide you with feedback on your changes and what, if any, additional changes we’d like to see before bringing them into the master file
3.  Once we are on the same page about your proposed changes, we will go ahead and manually merge them into the master file
